# This .gitkeep file ensures the .sqlx directory is tracked by Git
#
# The .sqlx directory contains SQLx query metadata files (*.json) that are
# used for offline compilation mode. These files are generated by running:
#
#   ./scripts/dev/sqlx-prepare.sh
#
# The metadata files enable SQLx to validate SQL queries at compile time
# without requiring a live database connection. This is essential for:
# - CI/CD pipelines
# - Docker builds
# - Air-gapped environments
# - Reproducible builds
#
# When to regenerate .sqlx files:
# - After adding, modifying, or removing SQL queries
# - After running database migrations
# - When query validation fails in CI/CD
# - Before committing query changes
#
# For more information, see docs/development/sqlx-setup.md

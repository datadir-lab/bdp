# Test Fixtures Directory

This directory contains test data for E2E testing of the BDP ingestion pipeline.

## Structure

- `uniprot_ci_sample.dat` - Small UniProt sample for CI (committed to repo)
  - ~100 proteins in real UniProt DAT format
  - Fast execution for CI/CD pipelines
  - Always available, no network required

- `real/` - Downloaded real UniProt data for local development (gitignored)
  - Downloaded on first run via `just e2e-download-data`
  - Cached and reused for subsequent test runs
  - Provides realistic testing environment
  - See `real/.gitkeep` for details

## Usage

**CI Mode** (GitHub Actions):
- Uses `uniprot_ci_sample.dat` (committed)
- Fast, reliable, no external dependencies

**Dev Mode** (Local):
- First run: Downloads real data with `just e2e-download-data`
- Subsequent runs: Reuses cached data
- Idempotent - won't re-download if data exists
- To refresh: Delete `real/` directory and re-run

## Adding Test Data

To update the CI sample:
1. Download a recent UniProt release
2. Extract ~100 representative proteins
3. Save as `uniprot_ci_sample.dat`
4. Commit to repository

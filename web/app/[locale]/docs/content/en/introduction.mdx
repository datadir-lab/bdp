# Introduction

Welcome to the BDP (Bioinformatics Dependencies Platform) documentation.
BDP is a comprehensive platform for managing bioinformatics software dependencies,
making it easier to discover, share, and manage tools for the bioinformatics community.

## What is BDP?

BDP provides a centralized registry and management system for bioinformatics tools and data sources.
It helps researchers and developers:

- Discover bioinformatics tools and packages
- Manage software dependencies for reproducible research
- Share tools and data sources with the community
- Track versions and updates of bioinformatics resources

## Quick Start

Get started with BDP in just a few steps:

1. **Install BDP CLI** - Follow the [installation guide](/docs/installation)
2. **Initialize a project** (creates audit trail automatically)
   ```bash
   bdp init --name my-project
   ```
3. **Add a data source**
   ```bash
   bdp source add uniprot:P01308-fasta@1.0
   ```
4. **Pull data** (all operations are audited)
   ```bash
   bdp pull
   ```
5. **Verify integrity**
   ```bash
   bdp audit
   ```
6. **Export audit report** (for publications)
   ```bash
   bdp audit export --format das --output data-availability.md
   ```
